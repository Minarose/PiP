# Hub Metrics

To compare the maps generated by PiP, we computed the most commonly used hub metrics from graph theory, including **degree**, **betweenness centrality**, and **PageRank** on the same functional connectivity adjacency matrices in data. The metrics were computed using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT)

All results are saved in a single file:

- `hub_metrics_all_subjects.mat`
  - `deg_all` (subjects × nodes)
  - `bc_all` (subjects × nodes)
  - `pr_all` (subjects × nodes)

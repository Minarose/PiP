## **Overview**  
PiP (Participation in Percolation) is a toolbox for identifying network hubs using a data-driven approach based on probabilistically sampled node attacks and percolation-based collapse analysis.

To validate the method and demonstrate its biological relevance, we apply PiP to magnetoencephalography (MEG) data collected during an expressive language task in a pediatric cohort, localizing functionally relevant language network hubs.

# Hub Metrics

To compare the maps generated by PiP, we computed well-stablished hub metrics from graph theory, including **degree**, **betweenness centrality**, and **PageRank**, on the same functional connectivity adjacency matrices located in `data/`. The metrics were computed using the [Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT)](https://sites.google.com/site/bctnet/).

All results are saved in a single file:

- `hub_metrics_all_subjects.mat`
  - `deg_all` (subjects × nodes)
  - `bc_all` (subjects × nodes)
  - `pr_all` (subjects × nodes)

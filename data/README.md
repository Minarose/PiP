# Input Adjacency Matrices

This folder contains individual subject adjacency matrices representing broadband undirected functional connectivity across nodes of the expressive language network during a covert verb generation task in children and adolescents.
##
Each matrix was derived from magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings in a pediatric cohort performing an expressive language task. Connectivity was estimated using the phase slope index (PSI), a measure of phase-based coupling, 
across a predefined 66-node expressive language network. Matrices were thresholded using the absolute normalized PSI (|PSInorm| ≥ 2), aggregated across frequency bands using the L2 norm, and binarized, resulting in undirected, sparse adjacency matrices with 3.9–11.9% density (mean = 6.6%).

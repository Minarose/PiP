# PiP Analysis Results

This folder contains per-subjectâ€™s **node participation matrix**, generated by simulating 1 million random attack sequences on their expressive language network graph in the data directory. These simulations estimate how frequently each node contributes to network fragmentation at different percolation steps.

The resulting matrix represents, for each percolation point, the proportion of simulations in which a given node was involved in the network breakdown.
